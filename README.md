# Improving Robotic Spinal Surgery Precision and Safety with Advanced Imaging Techniques

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and data related to the Master's thesis project aiming to enhance the precision and safety of spinal surgeries using advanced imaging techniques and deep learning-based segmentation.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project include:
- Preparing RGB-D spine data collected from cadaveric experiments.
- Developing a deep learning or transformer-based neural network for vertebra segmentation.
- Implementing real-time tracking for automated surgical operations.
- Evaluating the algorithm's performance on a spine phantom.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project include:
- Preparing RGB-D spine data collected from cadaveric experiments.
- Developing a deep learning or transformer-based neural network for vertebra segmentation.
- Implementing real-time tracking for automated surgical operations.
- Evaluating the algorithm's performance on a spine phantom.
